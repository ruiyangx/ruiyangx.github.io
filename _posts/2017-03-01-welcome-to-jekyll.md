Hi, my name is Ruiyang Xu, please call me Rui (extactly pronounced as "ray")!

Here on this page are a few samples of my previous work. My [resume]() and [contact information]() can be found through the links. Unfortunately, a majority of my works cannot be shown here for confidentiality reason. But please feel free to reach out if you'd like to discuss my previous experience and skill sets, or just have a quick chat (more than welcomed to ask me about my trips to ~30 states last year powered by Amtrak, greyhound, and at one time, hailing).

You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.


To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
